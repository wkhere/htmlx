Finder family:
	+ monad-style Finder
	+ tests for nil guards
	+ FindSibling (non-recursive)
	- FindInSiblings (recursive)
	+ FindByClass
	- why it got slower
	- concurrency?

	possible optimization: type Finder *html.Node,
	this is against the spec (receiver base type can't be pointer)

	think of some vm for searching!
	then use a language to describe a search
	inspired by rsc's regexp2 article

parsehtml binary:
	+ parse also local files
	+ show whitespace-only data in a compact way
	+ trim empty attributes
	- coverage
